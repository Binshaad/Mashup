    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language used to 
        describe how HTML elements should appear on a webpage. 
        It allows developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall
         design of a website. By separating the structure (HTML) from the style (CSS), 
         web pages become easier to maintain and more flexible to design changes.</p>

        <p>CSS can be added to a webpage in three ways: inline, internal, and external.
             Inline CSS is written directly inside an HTML element &apos; style attribute,
              internal CSS is placed within a &lt style &gt; tag inside the &lt; head &gt; section,
               and external CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML page. 
               The external method is commonly used because it keeps design rules organized and reusable across multiple pages.</p>
